# An Automatic Approach for Fruit Classification and Freshness Detection using Deep Learning

## This project is carried out for the partial fulfillment of the requirement for the award of the degree of Master of Science. It's a collaborative effort of my and my classmate(Anindita Sinha).

## Motivation

### Deep learning, computer vision, and image processing techniques have made significant strides, and these developments present exciting chances to get around the drawbacks of manual methods. Fruit classification and rotten fruit identification might both be automated, greatly improving the speed, precision, and consistency of both procedures. Faster grading and sorting, better inventory control, less waste, andbetter product quality assurance would all be made possible. Furthermore, it would lessen the possibility of selling rotten fruits, safeguarding consumer health and avoiding costs for businesses.
